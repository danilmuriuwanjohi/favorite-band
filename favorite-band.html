He is also known to have written songs for artists like Wendy Kimani, Elani, and Amos & Josh. Many people were shocked to discover that Bien is the step-son of the defamed Deputy Chief Justice Nancy Baraza. The former judiciary deputy revealed this during an interview, a matter that she had managed to keep secret for a very long time. Does Baraza have a girlfriend or is he married? The talented Sauti Sol member is married to Nigerian fitness queen, Chiki Onwekwe Kuruka. You have probably seen her on the television show Slim Possible of Citizen TV.
